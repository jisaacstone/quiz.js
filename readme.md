This is a programming quiz for non-programmers.

I could not find a short answer quiz framwork that vaidated results instantly, so I wrote one.

Additionally it varies some of the questions by using a random number.

It is easily hackable by anyone who knows how to 'view source', but good enough for my purposes.
